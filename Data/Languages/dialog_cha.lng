// mermaid
npc_mermaid_0 When I was swimming in the bay, the waves took a very important necklace from around my neck! If you find it, I will let you take a scale from my tail!
npc_mermaid_1 I have already looked around here!
npc_mermaid_2 Ahh! That's it! That's my necklace! Give it! Give it back! I will give you a scale as I said!
npc_mermaid_3 Promise! You'll only take one!

// rabbit
rabbit_0_0 Hey! Did ya know Animal Village and Mabe Village are sister cities? Yes, even though they aren't large enough to be called cities... Anyway, I heard from a very good source that they have a Dream Shrine in Mabe, and that it has something good inside... Is that true?
rabbit_0_1 I dreamed that I turned into a carrot last night... What an odd dream...

rabbit_1_0 I can't go to Mabe Village because of all the monsters. I hope Marin is all right.
rabbit_1_1 Eh? How can an animal talk? How? Hey, I'm just a rabbit, so I don't know!

rabbit_2_0 Yarna Desert? There's a way to get there to the south, but you might not be able to get through if that lazy walrus is in the way!
rabbit_2_1 Have you heard of the Flying Rooster? They say it lived in Mabe Village a long time ago... I wonder if it's true...

rabbit_3_0 Ahhh... Sigh... On such a nice day, we need a song from Marin!
rabbit_3_1 Aaaah, Little Marin... I want her to come back again...Her song is the best...

// == owl ==
owl_1_0 Hoot! Hoot!\nSo you are the lad who owns the sword...\fNow I understand why the monsters are starting to act so violently...\fA courageous lad has come to wake the Wind Fish...\fIt is said that you cannot leave the island unless you wake the Wind Fish...\fYou should now go north, to the Mysterious Forest.\nI will wait for you there! Hoot!
owl_1_1 Hoot! Ho, brave lad, on your quest to wake the dreamer! Welcome to the Mysterious Wood! Much of mystery you will find on this uncharted Koholint island! I'm afraid you may find it a trifle difficult to leave the island while the Wind Fish naps. ...By the by, have you ever visited the Tail Cave, which is south of the village? Go there with the key you find in this forest... The Wind Fish is watching... Hoot!
owl_1_2 Hoot! Take the key and go to the Tail Cave. Retrieve the Instrument that is hidden there! Go now! The Wind Fish is waiting! Hooot!

owl_2_0 Hoooot! That is an 'Instrument of the Sirens!' I have to admit, at first I did not believe you were real... That Instrument, along with the seven others in the set, has the power to wake the Wind Fish! You must collect them all! I was instructed to give you directions... Your next goal is north, in Goponga Swamp!! Hoot, indeed!
owl_2_1 Hoot! That is a fearsome looking animal you have there! Do not forget, the next Instrument is in Goponga Swamp!

// post dungeon 3
owl_3_0 Hoot! How many Instruments have you gotten so far? When you play the Instruments in front of the Egg, the Wind Fish will wake and you will leave this island. Now, you must hasten to the Yarna Desert! The dark, monstrous inhabitants of the sand will show you the way! Hoot Hoot!
owl_3_1 Hoot! The shape of the key shows a fish, swimming up a cascade of water! Go now to the mountain waterfall! A leap from the top and you will reach your goal!

// at the grave of the ghost
owl_5_0 Hoot! It has been some time since our paths crossed, lad. You must dive into the waters of Martha's Bay to enter the Catfish's Maw... The closer you get to the Wind Fish, the more restless he sleeps. Carry onward! Hoot!

// owl sitting infront of the egg on the stairs
owl_stairs Hoooot! The Wind Fish sleeps long and dreamily in the Egg above... When you play the eight Siren Instruments in front of the Egg he will awaken. This, my friend, is the only way for you to leave the island! Hoo!

// pre dungeon 6
owl_6_0 Hoot! There are two shrines, one to the north, the other to the south. First, head south, where ancient ruins speak of the Wind Fish... You will learn much there...
owl_6_1 Hoot! I see you have read the relief... While it does say the island is but a dream of the Wind Fish, no one is really sure... Just as you cannot know if a chest holds treasure until you open it, so you cannot tell if this is a dream until you awaken... The only one who knows for sure is the Wind Fish... Trust your feelings... Someday you will know for sure...

// after dungeon 6
owl_7_0 Hoot! The many monsters of this island fear that the Wind Fish is about to awaken! The monsters' power is real! They may conquer the island and destroy their foes! That day may come soon! Now, go to the mountain tower! Fly like a bird! Hoot! Hoot!
// after dungeon 6 on the mountain entry
owl_7_1 Hoot hoot! Your path is not easy, but you are almost there. Go east. The Wind Fish is getting restless.

// after saving marin
owl_8_0 Hoot! That girl sang her song in front of the Egg! Her 'Ballad of the Wind Fish' is a song of awakening! Did she actually intend to wake the Wind Fish?! The next Sirens' Instrument is in the west. Play your melodies so the unliving stones might hear! Show your courage! The Wind Fish waits for you! Hoot!

// after opening the egg
owl_9_0 The time has come... The Wind Fish awaits... Enter the Egg... Hoot! Hoot!

owl_final Hoot! Young lad, I mean... [NAME], the hero! You have defeated the Nightmares! You have proven your wisdom, courage and power! ... ... ... ... As part of the Wind Fish's spirit, I am the guardian of his dream world... But one day, the Nightmares entered the dream and began wreaking havoc. Then you, [NAME], came to rescue the island... I have always trusted in your courage to turn back the Nightmares. Thank you, [NAME]... My work is done... The Wind Fish will wake soon. Good bye...Hoot!
